# Leaflet Challenge


In this challenege, I pulled GeoJSON data from the [USGS website](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

Using this data, I plotted the occurences of earthquakes within the last 7 days, using the magnitude to determine the size of the circle markers and color to determine the depth of the earthquake. 

Popups were added for each marker that pull additional information about each earthquake: Location, Magnitude, Date/Time, and Depth.
